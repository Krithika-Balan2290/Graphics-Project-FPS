ReadMe File for HW3

What The Program Does:

1. On opening the window, a 3D scene is displayed consisting of houses, trees and Daleks in the streets. Textures are applied to all objects except the Daleks because they only have a metal body. A spherical light source provides lighting to the scene.
 
2. The objective of the game is to kill all the Daleks by shooting them in the eye. The dalek will be killed only if it is shot from within a given range.

3. While in the shot range, the Dalek will kill the user if it is not shot within 2 seconds. Kill all 5 Daleks in the scene to win.

4. Use arrow keys to move around the scene. The up arrow allows you to move forward and the down arrow allows you to move backward. The left and right arrows turn the user left and right respectively.

5. Use the '<' and '>' keys to strafe left and right, respectively.

6. Use spacebar to shoot the Dalek.

7. If the user is killed before shooting all the Daleks, a screen appears displaying that the user has lost. This screen also has a restart button which the user can click with the left mouse button to replay the game from the beginning.

8. Once the user kills all the Daleks, a screen appears displaying that the user has won. This screen also has a restart button which the user can click with the left mouse button to replay the game from the beginning.

9. Pressing the 's' key toggles the background music. This key is case insensitive.

10. Pressing the 'm' key toggles the view mode between perpective projection mode and first person navigation mode. This key is case insensitive.

10. Pressing the '+' key increases the field of view and the '-' key decreases the field of view.

11. The Page-up key increases the dimensions of the view and the Page-down key decreases the dimensions of the view. This effectively allows the user to zoom out and zoom in on the scene.

12. The '0' key resets the view angle and user position.

13. Press 'Esc' to exit the program.
